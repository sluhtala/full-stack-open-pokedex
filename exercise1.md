I selected the web development with Python and Django. According to the internet a popular linter is called Pylint at pylint.org. It seems to be recommended to use the build in unittest module in Python standard library. There are tools like Skulpt that allows python to be used in front-end development but I would imagine JavaScript to be much more convenient approach to it. But Python and Django has some popularity in the backend development.

Alternate tools for CI/CD are Atlassian Bamboo, CircleCI, TeamCity, Travis CI, BuildMaster Bitrise and Spinnaker. Github actions alternative could be Azure Pipeline, GitLab, Buildkite or Confluence. I don't know much about these but the most popular CI/CD tools would be Jenkins, CircleCI and TeamCiti according to quick googling.

With modern cloud technology existing such Amazon web services it would probably be possible to host in the cloud almost no matter how big the project or the team is. There are some advantages to self hosting but the team size of 6 people is still pretty small so it could be best to stick with the cloud option. But we don't know the actual scale of the project and way the team is orginized to say for sure.
